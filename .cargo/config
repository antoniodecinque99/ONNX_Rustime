# This configuration is specifically for macOS builds, both Intel (x86_64) and Apple Silicon (aarch64).
# Due to the way dynamic linking works on macOS, when building Rust code that interfaces with Python 
# (or other dynamic languages/frameworks), we need to specify some additional linker arguments.
#
# The "-C link-arg=-undefined" argument tells the linker to allow undefined symbols. This is crucial 
# because when the Rust code is loaded as a shared library (like a Python extension module), the 
# symbols will be resolved by the host (Python in this case).
#
# The "-C link-arg=dynamic_lookup" argument instructs the linker to look up symbols in all loaded 
# shared libraries, not just the one being created. This allows the Rust code to call functions and 
# use symbols from the host application, again, Python in this context.
#
# These flags help in creating a smooth FFI (Foreign Function Interface) experience between Rust and Python 
# on macOS.
